# Airport Optimization Using Predictive Models

## Solution Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting flight delays, enabling swift adjustments to the airport's airplane parking plan. By implementing this solution, we expect to reduce passenger wait times and optimize airport operations.

## Objective
The goal is to create a machine learning model, specifically a regression model, to predict flight delays based on various flight characteristics. These predictions will be crucial, as other optimization processes will use this information as input.

## Required Libraries
To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn` (`sklearn`)
- `matplotlib.pyplot`
- `seaborn`
- `yellowbrick`

## Analysis Environment
This project is designed to run on **Google Colaboratory**, where you can import the necessary libraries and load the dataset directly.
